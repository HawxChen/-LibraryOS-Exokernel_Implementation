Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. 
  Bearing in mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE just like everything else in the kernel
  , what is the purpose of macro MPBOOTPHYS? 
  Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in boot/boot.S?
  In other words, what could go wrong if it were omitted in kern/mpentry.S? 
  Hint: recall the differences between the link address and the load address that we have discussed in Lab 1.
ANS:
    #define MPBOOTPHYS(s) ((s) - mpentry_start + MPENTRY_PADDR))))
    MPBOOTPHYS is to calculate symobl address relative to MPENTRY_PADDR.
    The ASM is executed in the load address above KERNBASE, but JOS need to run mp_main at 0x7000 address!
    Of course 0x7000's page is reserved at pmap.c.
